### README
 This is a small React project to visualize a kid's schedule for a particular day. The data for the first iteration is hard-coded but contains a list of activities with start and end times. If a user (kid) opens the page at any time during the day, the current activity, along with the time left and elapsed time (progress), is displayed.

This is a nice visual representation for kids to plan their day and check the progress of each activity.
